# Python_Maps_Population_Volcanoes
This is a basic map created in python which helps to display the population of the countries based on the color (i.e. green for population &lt; 10000000 also orange if 10000000 &lt;= population &lt; 20000000 else red) and also diaplay's the volcanoes present in USA.
